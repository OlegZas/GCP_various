# Scheduled Query Execution Reports

## Goal

Set up a metrics table to evaluate the performance of all scheduled query runs under a specific project.

---

## 1. Create a Simple Topic

- No need to define an Avro schema.

---

## 2. Subscriber for the Topic

### a. Destination
- Write to BigQuery.
- Use table schema.

### b. Message Retention Duration

Gives your subscriber enough time to catch up in case of failures or downtimes.

- **Acknowledged Message:**
  1. You processed it successfully, and your subscriber sent an ack.
  2. ‚úÖ Pub/Sub removes it from the queue.

- **Unacknowledged Message:**
  1. Your subscriber crashed, timed out, or failed to ack.
  2. Or you didn‚Äôt send an ack within the acknowledgment deadline (e.g., 10‚Äì60 seconds).
  3. It will keep retrying until:
     - The message is acknowledged, or
     - The retention period expires (e.g., 7 days), or
     - The max delivery attempts (if dead-lettering is enabled) are exceeded.

### c. Other Configurations

- **Expiration period:** Never expire  
- **Acknowledgement deadline:** 10 seconds  
- **Transforms:** Optionally transform data columns before inserting  
- **Retry policy:** Retry after exponential backoff, minimum 10 seconds, maximum 600 seconds

## üîç TIP

To check what columns could be obtained from the message, set the subscriber to `PULL` mode to obtain the actual message payload.
