## What Can You Do Once a VM is Created?
- **Access the VM:** Use SSH (for Linux) or RDP (for Windows) to connect to your VM and start configuring it.
- **Install Software:** Install web servers, databases, development tools, and any other software you need for your projects.
- **Deploy Applications:** Upload and run your applications, whether they are web apps, APIs, or background processing jobs.
- **Run Scripts:** Execute scripts for automation, data processing, or system maintenance tasks.
- **Store Data:** Use the VM to store and manage data locally or connect to Google Cloud Storage for larger storage needs.
- **Connect with Other Services:** Integrate the VM with other GCP services (like Cloud SQL, BigQuery, etc.) for enhanced functionality.
