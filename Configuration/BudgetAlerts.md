## Budget Alerts in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

You can create **budget alerts** to warn you when you are about to reach specified billing thresholds.

GCP will send you an **email** once one of the specified thresholds is reached.

If you push the alert data into **Pub/Sub**, you will be able to use this data within your platform.
