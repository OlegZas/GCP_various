# Connecting Cloud SQL to a VM

Connecting a Cloud SQL instance to a VM allows your applications running on the VM to interact with the database hosted in Cloud SQL. Hereâ€™s how to connect them and the benefits of doing so:

## Why Connect Cloud SQL to a VM?
- **Centralized Data Management:** Cloud SQL provides a managed database solution, allowing you to focus on your application logic while Google handles database maintenance, backups, and updates.

- **Scalability:** With Cloud SQL, you can scale your database independently from your application. This is useful for handling varying loads without worrying about database performance.

- **Security:** Cloud SQL supports strong security practices, such as data encryption at rest and in transit, and access control through IAM roles.

- **Integration:** Easily integrate your applications with other GCP services, such as BigQuery for analytics, without the complexity of managing database infrastructure.

- **Ease of Use:** Cloud SQL abstracts much of the complexity involved in setting up and managing a database, making it easier to develop and deploy applications.
