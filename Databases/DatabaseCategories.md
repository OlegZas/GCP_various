# Database Categories

### Factors to Consider When Choosing a Database:
- Do you want a fixed schema?
- Atomicity of transactions?
- What kind of latency do you want? (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds)
- How many transactions do you expect? (hundreds, thousands, or millions of transactions?)
- How much data will be stored? (MBs, GBs, TBs, PBs, etc.)

## Relational Databases

- **Predefined schema** with tables and relationships
- **Very strong transactional capabilities**: One transaction can make updates to multiple tables and wonâ€™t be committed unless it succeeds.

### Used for:
- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**: Example use cases include banking and stock trading.
- **OLAP (Online Analytics Processing)**: Used for running many queries on huge amounts of data.

## OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
- Handles large numbers of users making a large number of transactions.
- Common in applications like **CRM**, **ERP**, **e-commerce**, and **banking**.

### Recommended on GCP:
- **Cloud SQL**: Supports regional databases up to a few TBs.
- **Cloud Spanner**: Scales unlimited (multiple PBs); recommended for global apps with users across the globe and horizontal scaling.

### Cloud SQL Setup:

1. **Connect to the instance**: 
   - (Provide connection steps here, e.g., via the GCP Console or command-line interface)
