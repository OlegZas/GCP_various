# In-memory Databases

- **Data Retrieval**: The data is retrieved from memory, not from disk.
- **Latency**: In-memory databases deliver microsecond latency by storing persistent data in memory.
- **Memory Store (in GCP)**: 
  - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers **Memory Store**, a fully-managed, in-memory data store service. 
  - It provides low-latency, high-throughput caching capabilities to accelerate application performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory. 
  - Memory Store supports both **Redis** and **Memcached**, which are popular open-source caching solutions.

## Use Cases:
- **Caching**: Improve the speed and performance of your applications.
- **Session Management**: Manage user sessions with low-latency access to data.
- **Gaming Leaderboards**: Store and retrieve real-time leaderboards in gaming applications.
- **Geospatial Applications**: Enable fast processing of geospatial data for applications like maps and location-based services.
