    1. Modernizing Infrastructure with the Cloud 
Virtualization is a form of resource optimization that lets multiple systems run on the same hardware.

A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It allows you to run an operating system (OS) and applications in an isolated environment on top of a host computer. 

Compute engine is Google Cloud's infrastructure as a service product, that lets users create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure.
    • Each virtual machine contains the power and functionality of a full fledged operating system.
    • A virtual machine instance can be created through the Google Cloud Console, which is a web based tool to manage Google Cloud
An API or application programming interface, is a set of instructions that allows different software programs to communicate with each other.
Containers - virtualize software layers above the operating system level (unlike VMs). 
    • Faster and more efficient than the VM 
    • A container is packaged with your application and all of its dependencies, so it has everything it needs to run.
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 
    • It makes it easy to orchestrate many containers on many hosts, scale them, and easily deploy rollouts and rollbacks.
Google Kubernetes Engine or GKE is a Google hosted, managed Kubernetes service in the Cloud.
    • The GKE environment consists of multiple machines, specifically compute engine instances grouped to form a cluster.
    • GKE makes it easy to deploy applications by providing an API and a Web based console.
Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform to deploy and run containerized applications without needing to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
    • After your application code is containerized and deployed to Cloud Run, Google Cloud takes care of scaling and managing the infrastructure automatically.
Serverless Computing: 
    • Serverless computing doesn't mean there's no server, it means that resources like compute power are automatically provisioned in the background as needed.
GCP provides: 
Cloud Run which is a fully managed environment for running containerized applications.
    • With this product, you don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
Cloud functions, which is the platform for hosting simple single purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your Cloud infrastructure and services.
    • For example, sending a notification to a mobile device when a new order is placed on a website.
App Engine, which is a service to build and deploy web applications.


    2. Application Modernization 
    
Application is a computer, program or software that helps users do something.
Modern Cloud Applications Development 
    • Modern cloud applications are typically built as a collection of microservices.
    • Microservices are independently deployable, scalable and maintainable components that can be used to build a wide range of applications and allow application features to be released without the rest of the application to be complete. 
GCP rehosting legacy applications: 
Lift and Shift - an application is moved from an  on-premises environment to a cloud environment without making  any changes to the application itself.

VMware Engine, which  helps migrate existing VMware workloads to   the cloud without having to rearchitect  the applications or retool operations.
Bare Metal Solution -  fully managed cloud infrastructure  solution that lets organizations run their   Oracle workloads on dedicated,  bare metal servers in the cloud.

APIs - application programming interfaces 
    • They allow applications to interact with each other in a standardized and efficient way 
    • An API is a set of instructions that lets different software programs communicate with each other.
    • They let developers access functionality and data from other programs without having to write all the code themselves, saving time and effort.
    • API takes a request from one software program and communicates with another program and returns a response 
    
Apigee API management - Google Cloud's API management service to operate API's with enhanced scale security and automation.
    • It helps with developing and deploying API's through a visual API editor and a test sandbox.
    • It offers API versioning, API documentation, and even API throttling, which is the process of limiting the number of API requests a user can make in a certain period.
Hybrid Cloud 
    • A hybrid cloud environment comprises some combination of on premises or private cloud infrastructure and public cloud services.
Multi cloud - A multi-cloud environment is where an organization uses multiple public cloud providers as part of its architecture.

GKE Enterprise is a managed production ready platform for running Kubernetes applications across multiple cloud environments.
