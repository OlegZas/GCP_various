# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## Narrow AI

**Narrow AI** focuses on performing specific tasks, such as:

- **Virtual Assistants**: Understands what you are saying and executes a few commands.
- **Self-Driving Cars**: Capable of driving vehicles autonomously.
- **Image Processing**: Detects and identifies objects in images.

## Machine Learning

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of Narrow AI that learns from data examples. It builds predictive models by training on large datasets. 

- **Training a Model**: 
  - To build an ML model, you use millions of examples (data) to train the system.
  - Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions, such as identifying objects in images.

## Pre-built ML Models in GCP

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers a range of pre-built ML models accessible via APIs:

- **Speech-to-Text API**: Converts spoken language into text.
- **Text-to-Speech API**: Converts text into spoken language.
- **Translation API**: Translates text between different languages.
- **Natural Language API**: Derives insights from unstructured text (e.g., sentiment analysis, entity recognition).
- **Cloud Vision API**: Provides image intelligence, including:
  - **Classifying Images**: Classifies images into predefined categories.
  - **Object and Face Detection**: Detects objects and faces within images.
  - **Text Recognition**: Reads and extracts printed words from images.
