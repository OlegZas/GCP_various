IaaS - infrastructure as a service offers compute and storage services
PaaS - platform as a service offers a develop-and-deploy environment to build cloud apps
SaaS - software as a service delivers apps as services, where users get access to software on a subscription basis.


Different ways organizations can implement their information technology (or IT) infrastructure.
	1. on-premises (on-prem) - hardware and software located on site 
	2. private cloud public cloud, 
	3. hybrid cloud
	4. Multicloud implementations
	
	
	
	A private cloud is hosted within an organization’s own private servers, either at an organization’s own data center, at a third-party colocation facility, or by using a private cloud provider.
	
	Private cloud computing gives businesses many of the benefits of a public cloud—including self-service, scalability, and elasticity—with more customization available from dedicated on-premises infrastructure.
	Organizations might use private cloud if they have already made significant investments in their own infrastructure
	
	
	The public cloud is where on-demand computing services and infrastructure are managed by a third-party provider, such as Google Cloud, and shared with multiple organizations or “tenants” through the public internet.
	• This sharing is why public cloud is known as multi-tenant cloud infrastructure, but each tenant’s data and applications running in the cloud are hidden from other tenants.


In a hybrid cloud, applications run in a combination of different environments.
The most common hybrid cloud example is combining a public and private cloud environment, like an on-premises data center and a public cloud computing environment, like Google Cloud.


The term multicloud describes architectures that combine at least two public cloud providers.
	• Organizations might operate a combination of on-premises and multiple public cloud environments, therefore implementing both hybrid and multicloud simultaneously.
	
	
	
	
	Benefits of clouds: 
	1. Scalable 
	2. Flexible - can be accessed from anywhere; services can be scaled up or down
	3. Agile - applications can be rapidly developed to production without worrying for underlying infrastructure 
	4. Strategic value - cloud providers are updated on the latest innovations 
	5. Security - Stronger than enterprise data centers because of depth and breadth of the security mechanisms and dedicated teams that cloud providers implement.
	6. Cost effective - pay for what is used; no overbuilding data centers. 
	
	Open standard refers to software that follows particular specifications that are openly accessible and usable by anyone.
	Open source refers to software whose source code is publicly accessible and free for anyone to use, modify, and share.
	
	Google Cloud Adaptation Network - It provides a solid assessment of where an organization is in its cloud journey and actionable programs that get it to where it wants to be. A map of tasks that organizations need to adopt a cloud. 
	
	A cloud maturity assessment helps to establish where an organization is currently regarding the cloud adoption themes recognized by Google Cloud.

Open infrastructure - technology and systems that adhere to open standards and are often built on open source software. Here are the key aspects of what "based on open infrastructure" means:

Open Standards: Infrastructure components and technologies that conform to open standards ensure interoperability and compatibility across different systems and vendors. This allows for easier integration and flexibility in the choice of tools and services.

Open Source Software: Software that is open source means its source code is freely available, can be modified, and is often developed collaboratively by a community of contributors. Using open source software in infrastructure allows organizations to customize and extend functionalities according to their specific needs.

Community Support: Open infrastructure typically benefits from a large community of developers and users who contribute to its development, provide support, and continuously improve the software. This community-driven approach fosters innovation and rapid evolution of the infrastructure.

Vendor Independence: Open infrastructure reduces dependency on any single vendor, mitigating the risks of vendor lock-in. Organizations have the freedom to choose different vendors for different components or switch providers without major disruptions.

Transparency and Security: Open infrastructure tends to be more transparent because its source code is openly accessible and auditable. This transparency enhances security as vulnerabilities can be identified and addressed promptly by the community.

Overall, being "based on open infrastructure" emphasizes openness, flexibility, community collaboration, and reduced dependency on proprietary technologies, contributing to greater innovation, interoperability, and long-term sustainability for organizations.
