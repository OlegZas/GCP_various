Modernize Infrastructure and Applications with Google Cloud
Workload is a specific application, service, or capability that can be run in the Cloud or on premises.
•	Workloads include containers, databases, and virtual machines.
•	Retiring a workload means removing it from a platform.
•	Retaining a workload means that it's intentionally kept. When a workload is retained, it's typically kept on premises or in a hybrid Cloud environment.
•	Rehost refers to the migration of a workload to the Cloud without changing anything in the workload's code or architecture.
o	Often 1st step in Cloud Migration. Often referred to as “LIFT AND SHIFT” 
•	Replatform refers to the process of migrating a workload to the Cloud while making some changes to the workloads code or architecture. 
o	Often called MOVE AND IMPROVE 
•	Refactoring - refers to the process of changing the code of a workload.
o	an organization might Refactor a workload to use either a Cloud-based microservices architecture or a Cloud-based server-less architecture.
•	Reimagine refers to the process of rethinking how an organization uses technology to achieve its business goals.
o	Changing cloud strategy
o	Using other technologies such as AI and Machine Learning 
Infrastructure in the Cloud:
Compute - refers to a machine's ability to process information
o	Associated tasks include storing, retrieving, comparing, and analyzing the information.
Total Cost Of Ownership, or TCO - a measure of the total cost of a system or solution over its lifetime.
o	It includes the cost of the initial purchase, maintenance and operation, along with any other associated costs.
Scalability - refers to the ability to increase or decrease the number of resources such as servers, storage, and bandwidth that are available to a Cloud-based application to meet changing demand.
Security - In addition to physical data center security, Cloud security features include data encryption, identity and access management, network security, virtual private Clouds, and monitoring services that can detect and respond to security threats in real time.
Abstraction - refers to how Cloud providers remove the need for customers to understand the finer details of the infrastructure implementation by providing management of the hardware, software, and certain aspects of security and networking.
Virtualization is a form of resource optimization that lets multiple systems run on the same hardware.
Virtual Machines or VMs - they share the same pool of processing, storage, and networking resources.
o	VMs enable organizations to run multiple applications at the same time on a server in a way that is efficient and manageable.
Compute engine is Google Cloud's infrastructure as a service product, that lets users create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure.
