#  Infrastructure and Applications with Google Cloud

## Workload

A workload is a specific application, service, or capability that can be run in the Cloud or on-premises.

- **Workloads** include containers, databases, and virtual machines.
- **Retiring a workload** means removing it from a platform.
- **Retaining a workload** means that it's intentionally kept. When a workload is retained, it's typically kept on-premises or in a hybrid Cloud environment.
- **Rehost** refers to the migration of a workload to the Cloud without changing anything in the workload's code or architecture.
  - Often the first step in Cloud Migration. Often referred to as **“LIFT AND SHIFT”**.
- **Replatform** refers to the process of migrating a workload to the Cloud while making some changes to the workload's code or architecture.
  - Often called **MOVE AND IMPROVE**.
- **Refactoring** refers to the process of changing the code of a workload.
  - An organization might **Refactor** a workload to use either a Cloud-based microservices architecture or a Cloud-based serverless architecture.
- **Reimagine** refers to the process of rethinking how an organization uses technology to achieve its business goals.
  - Changing cloud strategy.
  - Using other technologies such as AI and Machine Learning.

## Infrastructure in the Cloud

### Compute

**Compute** refers to a machine's ability to process information.

- Associated tasks include storing, retrieving, comparing, and analyzing information.

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

**Total Cost Of Ownership (TCO)** is a measure of the total cost of a system or solution over its lifetime.

- It includes the cost of the initial purchase, maintenance and operation, along with any other associated costs.

### Scalability

**Scalability** refers to the ability to increase or decrease the number of resources such as servers, storage, and bandwidth that are available to a Cloud-based application to meet changing demand.

### Security

**Security** in the Cloud includes:

- Physical data center security.
- Data encryption.
- Identity and access management.
- Network security.
- Virtual private Clouds.
- Monitoring services that can detect and respond to security threats in real-time.

### Abstraction

**Abstraction** refers to how Cloud providers remove the need for customers to understand the finer details of infrastructure implementation by providing management of the hardware, software, and certain aspects of security and networking.

### Virtualization

**Virtualization** is a form of resource optimization that lets multiple systems run on the same hardware.

- **Virtual Machines (VMs)** share the same pool of processing, storage, and networking resources.
  - VMs enable organizations to run multiple applications at the same time on a server in a way that is efficient and manageable.

### Compute Engine

**Compute Engine** is Google Cloud's infrastructure as a service product that lets users create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure.
