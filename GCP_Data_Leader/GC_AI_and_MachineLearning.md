# **Google Cloud Artificial Intelligence**

**Artificial intelligence (AI)** is a broad field that refers to the use of technologies to build machines and computers that can mimic cognitive functions associated with human intelligence. These functions include the ability to:

- **See, understand, and respond to spoken or written language**
- **Analyze data**
- **Make recommendations**

## **Generative AI**

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can produce new content, including:

- **Text**
- **Images**
- **Audio**
- **Synthetic data**

## **Machine Learning**

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that allows a machine to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It relies on various models to:

- **Analyze large amounts of data**
- **Learn from insights**
- **Make predictions and informed decisions**

**ML** provides a method to teach a computer how to solve problems by feeding examples of correct answers.

### **Benefits of Machine Learning**

ML helps in:

1. **Replacing or simplifying rule-based systems**
2. **Automating processes**
3. **Understanding unstructured data**
4. **Personalization**

## **Quality of Data Dimensions**

The quality of data can be assessed based on the following dimensions:

1. **Completeness** - Refers to whether all required information is present. Incomplete data can lead to inaccurate predictions.
2. **Uniqueness and Variety** - Ensures data has sufficient variety and uniqueness to be useful.
3. **Timeliness** - Data should be up-to-date and reflect the current state of the phenomenon being modeled.
4. **Validity** - Data should conform to predefined standards and definitions, such as type and format.
5. **Accuracy** - The correctness of data, such as correct birth dates or accurate sales figures.
6. **Consistency** - Ensures data is uniform and free of contradictory information.

### **Pre-trained APIs**

Pre-trained APIs are ideal for organizations without specialized data scientists but with business analysts and developers. Examples include:

- **Vision API** - Assigns labels to images and classifies them into millions of predefined categories.
- **Natural Language API** - An out-of-the-box, pre-trained API for analyzing text.

### **Vertex AI**

**Vertex AI** brings together Google Cloud services for building ML under one unified user interface:

- **AutoML and Vertex AI** let you build and train machine learning models from end to end using graphical user interfaces (GUIs), often without writing any code.
- **AutoML** chooses the best machine learning model by comparing different models and tuning parameters after your data is ingested.

**AutoML Natural Language** allows you to build and deploy custom ML models to analyze documents, categorize them, identify entities, or assess attitudes.

### **TensorFlow**

**TensorFlow** is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It includes:

- **A flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources**
- **Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)** - Googleâ€™s application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) used to accelerate machine learning workloads.
