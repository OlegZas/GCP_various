Google Cloud Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence is a broad field which refers to the use of technologies to build machines and computers that can mimic cognitive functions associated with human intelligence.
	• These functions include, being able to see, understand, and respond to spoken or written language, analyze data, make rec
	• Generative AI 
	This is a type of artificial intelligence that can produce new content, including text, images, audio, and synthetic data.
	
Machine learning is a subset of AI that lets a machine learn from data without being explicitly programmed. 
	• It relies on various models to analyze large amounts of data, learn from the insights, and then make predictions and informed decisions.
	• Machine learning models at the output, or what the program learns from running an algorithm on training data.
	ML provides a method to teach a computer how to solve problems by feeding examples of the correct answers.
	IT HELPS: 
		1. Replacing or simplifying rule-based systems 
		2. Automate processes 
		3. Understanding unstructured data 
		4. Personalization 
Machine Learning Options on Google Cloud: 
Pre-trained APIs - 
These are ideal in situations where an organization doesn't have specialized data scientists, but it does have business analysts and developers.

The developer can use Vision API to assign labels to images and quickly classify them into millions of predefined categories.

The natural language API is another out of the box, pre trained API.


Vertex AI brings together Google Cloud services for building ML under one unified user interface.
	• AutoML and Vertex AI lets you build and train machine learning models from end to end by using graphical user interfaces.
	• Often referred to as GUIs without writing a line of code.
	• This means that after your data is ingested into Vertex AI, AutoML chooses the best machine learning model for you by comparing different models and tuning parameters.
AutoML natural language lets you build and deploy custom machine learning models.
The analyzed documents, categorize them, identify entities within them, or assess attitudes within them.

TensorFlow, which is an end to end open source platform for machine learning.
	• TensorFlow has a flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that enable researchers to innovate in ML and developers to build and deploy ML powered applications.
	• Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) - Google’s application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that is used to accelerate machine learning workloads?
