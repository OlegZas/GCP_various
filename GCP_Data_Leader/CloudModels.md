# Cloud Computing Models

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

**IaaS** is a computing model that offers the on-demand availability of almost infinitely scalable **infrastructure resources**, such as **compute**, **networking**, **storage**, and **databases** as services over the internet.

- **IaaS resources** are offered as individual services, so organizations can choose what they need.
- Resources are used on demand, and you pay for what you use.
- If an organization has the in-house expertise and willingness to manage the infrastructure, it can build solutions using **IaaS resources**. The IT team would have complete control over server configurations but would also bear the burden of managing and maintaining them.



## PaaS (Platform as a Service)

**PaaS** is a computing model that offers a cloud-based platform for developing, running, and managing applications.

- **PaaS** provides a framework for developers that they can build upon to create customized applications.
- **Cloud Run** and **BigQuery**:
  - **Cloud Run** is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting applications at scale. It handles provisioning servers and scaling app instances based on demand.
- Organizations could choose a **PaaS** solution to build a custom CRM application while offloading infrastructure management to the cloud service provider. This allows them to retain control over application features while reducing the management load.

## SaaS (Software as a Service)

**SaaS** is a computing model that offers an entire application, managed by a cloud provider, through a web browser.

- The cloud provider hosts the application software in the cloud and delivers it through a browser.
- **Google Workspace**, which includes tools such as **Gmail**, **Google Drive**, **Google Docs**, and **Google Meet**, is a **Google Cloud SaaS** product.
- **SaaS solutions** require no daily management of infrastructure but also give up control over features and functionality in the software.

## Summary of Cloud Models

### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

- **Definition**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Delivers fundamental computing infrastructure like virtual machines, storage, and networking on a pay-as-you-go basis.
- **Example**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)

- **Definition**: Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. Typically includes middleware, development tools, database management systems, and more.
- **Example**: Google App Engine, Heroku, Microsoft Azure App Service.

### SaaS (Software as a Service)

- **Definition**: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access these applications via a web browser without needing to install or maintain the software locally.
- **Example**: Salesforce, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Dropbox.
