# Using App Engine to Create an App

App Engine is a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that allows you to build and deploy applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It automatically handles everything from provisioning, scaling, load balancing, monitoring, and security. Here's what itâ€™s mainly used for:

## Key Use Cases for App Engine

- **Web Applications**: App Engine is great for deploying scalable web apps in multiple programming languages like Python, Java, Go, Node.js, Ruby, and more.
  
- **Microservices**: You can build and deploy microservices where each component is independently scalable.

- **Backend Services**: App Engine is often used to build backend services for mobile apps, websites, or IoT systems, as it automatically scales to handle high traffic volumes.

- **Serverless Applications**: App Engine abstracts away all infrastructure concerns. You only need to focus on the code, and App Engine automatically scales and manages the servers.

- **API Backends**: You can use App Engine to host RESTful APIs and other backend services that need to scale efficiently.
