# REST API

Most applications today are built around REST APIs. Below is a brief overview:

## What is a REST API?

A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions that allow different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. It operates based on standard HTTP methods and focuses on accessing and managing resources using URLs.

## Key Concepts:

### 1. Resources
Resources are the objects or data the API interacts with. They are identified by URLs, such as:
- `/todos` (a list of to-do items)
- `/todos/{id}` (a specific to-do item by ID)

### 2. Actions (HTTP Methods)
These HTTP methods define the actions that can be performed on the resources:
- **GET**: Retrieve information from the server.
- **POST**: Create new resources on the server.
- **PUT**: Update existing resources.
- **DELETE**: Remove resources.

## Example:

Consider a to-do list application. Below are some typical RESTful API requests:

1. **GET /todos**: Fetches all to-do items.
2. **GET /todos/1**: Fetches the to-do item with ID 1.
3. **POST /todos**: Creates a new to-do item.
4. **PUT /todos/1**: Updates the to-do item with ID 1.
5. **DELETE /todos/1**: Deletes the to-do item with ID 1.

## Challenges of REST APIs:

1. **Scalability**: Handling large amounts of data or requests efficiently.
2. **Security**: Ensuring secure access and data protection.
3. **State Management**: Managing state between multiple requests in a stateless protocol.
4. **Versioning**: Updating API versions without breaking existing clients.
