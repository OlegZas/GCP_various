# Cloud PUB/SUB Overview

**Cloud PUB/SUB** follows a **Publisher > Subscriber** model.

---

## **Publisher App**

- Creates and sends messages to a **topic** (which is a named resource).
- Messages are stored until acknowledged by all subscribers.
- Can be any app that can make HTTPS requests to `GoogleApis.com`.

---

## **Subscriber App**

- Creates a subscription to a **topic** to receive stored messages.
- To receive the messages, the subscriber must create a subscription to the publisher's topic.
- The subscriber app receives messages by either:
  - **PUB/SUB pushing** them to the subscriber's chosen endpoint, or
  - **Subscriber pulling** them.
  
When the message is acknowledged by the subscriber, it is removed from the backlog and not delivered again.

# **The Flow of Data**

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Data is ingested into **Cloud Pub/Sub** from front-end services, databases, and other event producers.

2. **Message Storage**
   - **Cloud Pub/Sub** stores the ingested data as messages.

3. **Data Processing**
   - **Cloud Dataflow** or another event processing service receives the messages from **Cloud Pub/Sub** and enriches and processes the data.

4. **Data Output**
   - Processed data is sent to **warehouses** or **analytical tools** for further use.
