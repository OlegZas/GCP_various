# What is GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)?

**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** is a managed service for running **Kubernetes clusters** on **Google Cloud**. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

In GKE, your workloads are typically packaged in **containers**, which are lightweight, portable, and can run anywhere (on any environment, like on-premises, or in the cloud). GKE helps you manage these containerized workloads at scale with the features and flexibility of Kubernetes.

## What is a Cluster on Compute Engine?

A **Cluster on Compute Engine** means you're setting up a cluster using traditional **virtual machines (VMs)** on **Google Compute Engine (GCE)**. GCE provides scalable virtual machines that you can configure with the necessary software for running workloads such as **Apache Hadoop**, **Apache Spark**, **Hive**, etc.

With **Dataproc**, for example, you can create a cluster on Compute Engine, where Dataproc provisions VMs in a compute cluster to run big data processing frameworks. This setup allows you to run big data jobs, but you're dealing directly with VMs that are managed by Google Cloud, and you're responsible for configuring and scaling the VM-based infrastructure.

## Key Differences Between Cluster on Compute Engine and Cluster on GKE:

| **Feature**                      | **Cluster on Compute Engine**                      | **Cluster on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)**          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Underlying Technology**         | Virtual Machines (VMs)                             | Containers and Kubernetes                               |
| **Managed Service**               | Managed VMs by Google Cloud                        | Fully managed Kubernetes clusters by Google             |
| **Use Case**                      | Good for traditional VMs for big data processing (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Hive) | Ideal for containerized applications and microservices |
| **Cluster Management**            | VMs are created and managed directly, with less abstraction | Kubernetes manages the entire cluster automatically    |
| **Scalability**                   | Scale VMs manually or via autoscaling              | Kubernetes automatically manages scaling (pods, nodes, etc.) |
| **Containerization**              | No built-in container support; VMs run directly on the cluster | Kubernetes orchestrates containers (e.g., Docker containers) |
| **Workload Types**                | Primarily used for big data, custom workloads that run on VMs | Used for containerized workloads, microservices, and modern applications |
| **Flexibility**                   | High flexibility in terms of VM configuration and software stack | High flexibility in container management and orchestration |
| **Ease of Use**                   | Requires more manual setup and management of VMs   | Easier to manage containerized applications with Kubernetes automation |
| **Networking**                    | Configured through GCE networking (static IPs, etc.) | Managed by Kubernetes networking (e.g., pods, services, ingress) |
| **Integration with Kubernetes**   | No direct integration (unless using Kubernetes separately) | Full native integration with Kubernetes ecosystem      |

## When Should You Use Each?

### Cluster on Compute Engine (VM-based clusters):

- **Big Data Workloads**: If you're running workloads that require large-scale processing (e.g., Hadoop, Apache Spark, Hive) and you prefer using virtual machines to manage your resources.
- **Traditional Applications**: When you need a more traditional approach with VMs, or when you are working with software that is not yet containerized or doesn’t need Kubernetes.
- **Flexibility in Infrastructure**: If you need to customize the underlying VM environment, networking, and storage.

### Cluster on GKE (Kubernetes-based clusters):

- **Containerized Applications**: If your applications are already containerized or if you're planning to move towards containerized solutions, GKE is ideal.
- **Microservices and Modern Applications**: When you are developing and deploying applications using microservices and need automated deployment, scaling, and management.
- **Scalability and Automation**: If you want Kubernetes to handle the scaling and orchestration of workloads automatically, GKE can help simplify management and improve reliability.
- **Data Processing with Containers**: If you're processing data using frameworks that can be containerized (e.g., Spark, Flink), GKE is a great choice, especially with Kubernetes’ features like **Helm charts** and easy deployment automation.
