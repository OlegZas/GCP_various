# Google Cloud Run Functions 
- is a serverless way to run small pieces of code in the cloud. You don’t need to set up or manage any servers.

### You simply write a single-purpose function—just a short bit of code that does one thing—and link it to an event, like a file being uploaded to Cloud Storage or a message being sent to Pub/Sub.
### When that event happens, your function is automatically triggered and runs in a fully managed environment, which means Google takes care of all the underlying infrastructure like scaling, patching, or maintaining servers.

### Choosing ‘Other Eventtrac trigger’ allows you to choose from hundreds Google and Third-party service triggers. This is available with cloud functions 2nd gen only (1st gen had like 5 triggers).
