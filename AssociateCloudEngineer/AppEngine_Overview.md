# Google App Engine Overview

**Google App Engine** is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** offering from Google Cloud that allows developers to build and deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.

- Provides a **fully managed, serverless environment**, meaning developers don’t need to worry about provisioning or managing servers, scaling resources, or applying system updates and patches — all of that is handled automatically.
- **Automatic scaling** is built-in: resources such as CPU and memory scale up or down based on traffic and demand.
- **Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks**, including:
  - Python
  - Java
  - Go
  - Node.js
  - PHP
  - Ruby
  - Custom runtimes via Docker
- Offers built-in **security features** like:
  - **Firewall rules**
  - **SSL/TLS encryption**
  - Integration with **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

## App Engine Environments

Google App Engine offers two environments to cater to different needs:

### 1. Standard Environment
- Runs in a **sandboxed** environment designed for fast scaling and minimal management.
- Uses preconfigured runtimes.
- Has **instance startup and shutdown constraints**, but is optimized for high performance and cost-efficiency.
- Best suited for applications with predictable traffic patterns or bursty workloads.

### 2. Flexible Environment
- Runs your application in **Docker containers** on **Google Compute Engine VMs**.
- Supports **custom runtimes** and allows more control over the runtime and system configuration.
- Automatically handles VM provisioning, scaling, and load balancing, but offers more flexibility than the Standard environment.
- Suitable for applications requiring access to system-level features or third-party binaries.
