# Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer Certification Guide

## üìò Overview

The Associate Cloud Engineer (ACE) certification assesses an individual's ability to deploy applications, monitor operations, and manage enterprise solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This includes working with both public cloud and hybrid environments.

Key focus areas:
- GCP services and tools
- Best practices for security and cost
- Deploying and managing scalable solutions

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Section 1: Setting Up a Cloud Solution Environment (~20%)

### 1.1 Setting up Cloud Projects and Accounts

**üîë Key Concepts:**

#### üîπ Resource Hierarchy
Organization > Folders > Projects > Resources


- Centralized management of policies, access, and billing
- **Example:** A company uses folders for departments (Finance, HR), and projects for apps like Payroll or HR System

#### üîπ Organizational Policies

- Apply constraints (e.g., block external IPs on VMs)
- Managed through the Organization Policy page in the Console
- **Example:** Enforce `constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess` to block public IPs

#### üîπ IAM Role Assignment

- Roles can be granted at Organization, Folder, Project, or Resource level
- Role types: **Basic**, **Predefined**, **Custom**
- **Example:** Grant `roles/storage.admin` only for a specific bucket

#### üîπ Managing Cloud Identity

- Manage users with Google Cloud Identity
- Sync users from Active Directory or Google Workspace
- Automate user provisioning with SCIM

#### üîπ API Enablement

- APIs must be enabled before use
- **Example:** Enable BigQuery and Cloud Functions APIs before deploying a pipeline

#### üîπ Observability Setup

- Use Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver): Monitoring, Logging, Trace, etc.
- Centralized dashboard for metrics and logs

#### üîπ Quota Management

- Prevents resource overuse and cost overruns
- View quotas via Console under **IAM & Admin > Quotas**
- Request quota increases as needed

---

### 1.2 Managing Billing Configuration

**üîë Key Concepts:**

#### üîπ Billing Accounts

- Linked to one or more projects
- Can be associated with Google Workspace for consolidated billing

#### üîπ Budgets and Alerts

- Create budgets with thresholds (e.g., 50%, 90%)
- Alerts can be sent via email, Pub/Sub, or Slack
- **Example:** Set a $100 budget with alerts at 50% and 90%

#### üîπ Billing Exports

- Export data to BigQuery for analysis and forecasting
- **Example:** Identify the highest-cost services by project in BigQuery

**Storage Classes in GCS:**

| Class     | Description                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| Standard  | Frequent access                 |
| Nearline  | Accessed monthly                |
| Coldline  | Accessed quarterly              |
| Archive   | Long-term storage, rarely used  |

**Example:** Store logs in Coldline, daily reports in Standard

---

### 2.3 Network Resources

**Key Topics:**

- **Load Balancing:** HTTP(S), TCP/UDP, SSL; global or regional
- **Network Service Tiers:**  
  - Premium (Google's backbone)  
  - Standard (public internet)
- **Location Planning:** Choose regions/zones near users; use multi-region storage for redundancy
