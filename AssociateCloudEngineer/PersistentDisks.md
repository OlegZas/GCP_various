# Persistent Disks

## Persistent Disk â€“ Block Storage for Compute Engine VMs

Persistent Disks are block storage for Compute Engine VMs.

- By default, each Compute Engine instance has a single boot persistent disk (PD) that contains the operating system.
- When your apps require additional storage space, you can add one or more additional storage options to your instance.

## Key Features:
- High performance and reliability.

## Disk Types:
- **Standard (HDD)**: Cost-efficient for sequential reads/writes.
- **SSD**: High performance for IOPS-intensive workloads.
- **Balanced**: A mix of performance and cost-efficiency.

## Additional Features:
- Snapshots for backups and restoration.
