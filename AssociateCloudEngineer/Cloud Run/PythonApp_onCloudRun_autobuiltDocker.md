# Deploy a Python App as a JOB on Cloud RUN 
# <ins>without manually building Docker container.</ins>


> [!NOTE]
> ### 2nd Demo:
> 1.	Deploy the job from the source code (automatically will create a Docker image) 
> 2.	Schedule the job for desired frequency 

### 1.	To deploy a Python app as a job on the Cloud Run without manually building Docker image, youâ€™d deploy the job directly from the source code. In the back end, it will create a repository in Artifact Registry, build image, push it, and deploy cloud run. 

### 2.	In shell run : gcloud run jobs deploy
 -  a.	Navigate to the folder where you have the script (app.py and dockerfile)
