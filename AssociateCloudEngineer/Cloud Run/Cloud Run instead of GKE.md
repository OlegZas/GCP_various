# âœ… When to Use Cloud Run Instead of GKE

## Why Cloud Run?

- **Cheaper for infrequent use**: If your app runs only occasionally (like once a day), keeping GKE (Kubernetes) nodes running 24/7 wastes money.
- **Simpler to manage**: Cloud Run handles scaling and infrastructure automatically, perfect for small or simple containerized apps.

# ðŸ”„ Best Use Cases for Cloud Run

## Event-Driven Apps
*Example*: An app triggered by Pub/Sub messages or when files are uploaded to Cloud Storage.

## Low-Traffic Applications
*Example*: Internal tools or dashboards that are accessed a few times a day (e.g., admin portal).

## APIs or Microservices
*Example*: Lightweight APIs for mobile/web apps with unpredictable traffic.

## Batch Jobs or On-Demand Processing
*Example*: Generating reports, converting files, or resizing images when requested.

## Webhooks and Callbacks
*Example*: A webhook receiver for Stripe or GitHub that only runs when called.

## Cost-Sensitive Workloads
*Example*: Apps that don't need to be "always on" and where you want to avoid paying for idle time.
