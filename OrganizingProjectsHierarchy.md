## Steps to Create a Folder in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

1. **Go to "Manage Resources"** and click on **'Create Folder'**.  
   This can only be done if you have an **Organization** in GCP.

   - In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), if you do not have an organization, it means you are likely using a **Personal Google Account** or a **G Suite account** (which is not part of an organization).
   - To clarify, an **Organization** in GCP is typically tied to a **business** or **enterprise account** and is used to manage resources, billing, and access control across projects more efficiently.

2. **Add the Created Folder**.  
   You might need to add the **"Folder Admin"** permission to your account under the **Organization** in IAM (Identity and Access Management).
